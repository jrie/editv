# editv
A minimal C based text editor

Currently works on Windows only, due to no other file open/save interfaces being currently implemented.

This is a toy project with minimal dependencies, Graphics are rendered with [SDL3](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3) and everything else is either pure C or platform dependant.

It is currently very basic, but supports everything needed in a text editor

### Features

To view options hold 'ctrl' and press a corresponding key

's' - save file
'v' - paste from clipboard
'q' - quit
